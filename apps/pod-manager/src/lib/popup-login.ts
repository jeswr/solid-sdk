/**
 * popup-login.ts — the app-owned OAuth popup lifecycle (first-party login UI).
 *
 * Replaces the `<authorization-code-flow>` web component from
 * @solid/reactive-authentication: the PROTOCOL layer (WebIdDPoPTokenProvider)
 * stays, but the popup that drives the user through the authorization
 * endpoint is now owned by the app, so the React UI controls every state.
 *
 * The lifecycle rules (each one was a real bug class in popup logins):
 *
 * 1. **Open ONE named popup synchronously in the click handler — but ONLY
 *    when the login can actually need one.** Popup blockers allow
 *    `window.open` only while the user activation is live; the token provider
 *    needs async work (issuer discovery) before it knows the authorization
 *    URL. So the UI calls {@link openPopupUnlessRenewable} synchronously on
 *    click: when the provider's synchronous probe says a cached session or
 *    refresh token completes the login with fetches alone, NO window is
 *    opened (no about:blank flash); otherwise an `about:blank` named window
 *    opens immediately and the provider's later `getCode` NAVIGATES it —
 *    browsers allow navigating an already-open named window without fresh
 *    activation. When the probe was wrong (the refresh grant is rejected
 *    after the activation is spent), `getCode` finds no popup, the fresh
 *    `window.open` is blocked, and the flow recovers through the `onBlocked`
 *    affordance — never a raw unactivated open.
 * 2. **When the provider goes silent first, the interactive retry uses the
 *    SAME window.** On background re-auth the provider tries `prompt=none`;
 *    when the server answers `login_required` / `interaction_required` /
 *    `consent_required` the popup is kept open so the interactive retry
 *    re-navigates it (upstream reactive-authentication PR #13's insight —
 *    closing it would strand the retry behind the popup blocker, the original
 *    click's activation being already consumed). Explicit user-initiated
 *    logins skip the silent hop entirely (the provider navigates straight to
 *    the interactive authorize URL); this controller is mode-agnostic.
 * 3. **Strict message checks.** The callback page posts its URL (carrying the
 *    OAuth `code`) via `postMessage`; only messages whose `event.origin` is
 *    the callback's origin AND whose `event.source` is OUR popup window are
 *    accepted — anything else (extensions, hostile frames, other components)
 *    can neither end the flow nor spoof a code.
 * 4. **No dangling state.** Every exit path (code received, user closed the
 *    popup, app-side cancel, abort signal, timeout) removes the message
 *    listener, stops the closed-poll, and settles the promise exactly once.
