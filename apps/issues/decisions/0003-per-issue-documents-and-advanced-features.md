# 0003 — Milestone 3: per-issue documents, priority/labels, comments, per-issue ACLs, groups, SHACL

**Status:** accepted · **Date:** 2026-06-09

## Storage: one document per issue
Issues moved from a single `issues.ttl` to **one document per issue** in an
`issues/` LDP container, with a separate `tracker.ttl` config document:

```
<pod>/issue-tracker/tracker.ttl        # wf:Tracker config (#this) + category classes + assignee group
<pod>/issue-tracker/issues/<uuid>.ttl  # one issue (#this a wf:Task) + its comments
```

This is what makes **per-issue access control** possible — WAC/ACP applies per
resource, so a fragment in a shared document cannot be individually shared
(solid-scale-and-sharding: permission-driven splitting). Listing is container GET
+ per-member GET; writes are conditional PUTs on each issue's own ETag; delete is
a real DELETE. The repository (`src/lib/repository.ts`) replaces the old
single-document module.

## Priority & labels — `wf:issueCategory` category classes
Both are carried by `rdf:type` (the SolidOS model, like state). The tracker
declares category **classes** as fragments of `tracker.ttl`, via `wf:issueCategory`:

- Priority: `#priority-high|medium|low`, `rdfs:subClassOf #Priority` (fixed, ordered).
- Labels: `#label-<slug>`, `rdfs:subClassOf #Label` (user-defined, declared on use).

An issue derives these IRIs from its own `wf:tracker` link. No IRIs are minted at
non-resolving domains — the classes live in a served pod document.

## Comments — `wf:message`
Per-issue comments are `wf:Message` fragments in the issue document, linked via
`wf:message`: `sioc:content` (body), `foaf:maker` (author), `dct:created`.

## Per-issue ACLs & assignee groups
- Sharing (`src/lib/sharing.ts`) now applies to any resource: a single issue
  document **or** the container (with `acl:default` so it cascades to all issues —
  this is how "share the tracker" works). Owner control is always preserved.
- The tracker carries an assignee **group** (`wf:assigneeGroup` → `vcard:Group` +
  `vcard:hasMember`). Issues can be assigned to the group, and a resource can be
  shared with it via `acl:agentGroup` (`setGroupAccess`).

## SHACL
`shapes/issue.ttl` ships anonymous SHACL node shapes (`wf:Task`, `wf:Message`)
over the reused IRIs. `src/lib/shacl.test.ts` validates object-mapper output in CI
(`rdf-validate-shacl`). SHACL caught a real wrapper bug: `LiteralFrom.date` emits a
malformed `xsd:date` (dateTime lexical), so `wf:dateDue` is stored as `xsd:dateTime`.

## Trade-offs / deferred
- Listing is N+1 fetches (container + each issue) — fine at this scale; a pod
  SPARQL endpoint would be the scale answer.
- SHACL validation runs in CI, not in the browser bundle (keeps it lean).
- Future: label management UI (rename/delete), saved filters, notifications-driven
  live sync.
