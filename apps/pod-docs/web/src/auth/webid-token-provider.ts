 * webid-token-provider.ts — a custom @solid/reactive-authentication `TokenProvider`
 * whose OIDC issuer is resolved from the user's WebID profile (via callbacks),
 * instead of the published `DPoPTokenProvider`'s hard-coded host map.
 *
 * Ported from the published `DPoPTokenProvider` (v0.1.2), preserving its
 * authorization-code + PKCE + DPoP flow and its `prompt=none` silent-retry
 * behaviour. The ONE structural change: `#resolveIssuer()` dereferences the
 * WebID and reads `solid:oidcIssuer`, then asks `chooseIssuer` when several are
 * advertised — never silently the first.
 *
 * Two app-supplied callbacks drive identity:
 *  - `getWebId()`   — UI that asks the user for their WebID (see `promptWebIdDialog`).
 *  - `getCode(uri)` — the existing `<authorization-code-flow>` element's `getCode`.
 *
 * `allowInsecureLoopback` is what makes LOCAL CSS work: it flips oauth4webapi's
 * `allowInsecureRequests` ONLY for `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` issuers, so the HTTP
 * issuer of a dev CSS is accepted while remote HTTPS issuers stay strict.

/**
 * Per-probe side channel — an in-process registry keyed on the Request, NOT a
 * network header.
 *
 * A login probe must be able to prove THIS specific probe request — not merely
 * "some request" — was token-upgraded. The previous design stamped a custom
 * `x-reactive-auth-probe-id` HEADER on the probe fetch. That broke CROSS-ORIGIN
 * login: a custom request header makes the request non-"simple", so the browser
 * fires a CORS preflight (OPTIONS) that many Solid pods reject — the probe failed
 * before the 401/upgrade path ever ran. The fix sends NOTHING app-specific on the
 * wire; the probe id travels only in process memory.
 *
 * It has two layers because of how `ReactiveFetchManager` is built (verified
 * against the published 0.1.3 dist):
 *
 *   async #fetch(input, init) {
 *     const request = new Request(input, init);   // ← a NEW object
 *     ...                                          //   (input identity is dropped)
 *     const upgraded = await provider.upgrade(request);
 *   }
 *
 * The manager wraps our `fetch(request)` argument in `new Request(input)` BEFORE
 * calling `upgrade()`, and a `new Request(req)` copy is a DIFFERENT object (and a
 * symbol/expando does not survive the copy — only URL/method/headers do). So a
 * pure object-identity WeakMap keyed on the login flow's Request would never be
 * found by `upgrade()` — login detection would silently always read "not
 * upgraded". Hence:
 *
 *  1. {@link probeIdsByObject} — a `WeakMap<Request, string>` keyed on object
 *     IDENTITY. This is the precise, collision-proof channel and is consulted
 *     FIRST; it matches when the manager passes the SAME object through (e.g. a
 *     future/worker manager that does not re-wrap, or a direct `upgrade()` call in
 *     a unit test). GC-collected with the Request — no leak.
 *  2. {@link probeIdsByUrl} — a SINGLE-USE `Map<string, string>` keyed on the
 *     probe's URL, the one property that survives `new Request(input)`. It is the
 *     channel that actually carries the id across the manager's re-wrap. It is
 *     consumed (deleted) on the first lookup, so it fires for exactly ONE upgrade
 *     of that URL — the login probe — and a later same-URL data read cannot reuse
 *     it. The login probe is the only fetch to the storage-root URL during a login
 *     (the data layer is inactive mid-login), so URL keying is unambiguous here.
 *
 * `upgrade()` reads the id (via {@link probeIdForRequest}) at its entry on the
 * ORIGINAL request it received — before the clone it makes to add Authorization —
 * and records it into `#upgradedProbeIds` IFF it actually attaches a token. A
 * concurrent upgraded request for the SAME requested WebID (a different Request,
 * not this probe's URL/object) is not in the registry under the probe's id, so it
 * cannot make a non-upgraded probe look authenticated.
