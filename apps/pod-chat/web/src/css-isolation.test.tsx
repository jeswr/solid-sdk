// @vitest-environment jsdom
// AUTHORED-BY Claude Opus 4.8 (Fable unavailable) — re-review/upgrade candidate
//
// This test renders the app-shell React chrome (needs a DOM), so it opts into jsdom
// per-file — the suite default is `node` (see vitest.config.ts). The pragma MUST be
// the first line for vitest to honour it.
//
// CSS-ISOLATION REGRESSION GUARD (#80 / solid-elements rollout #67/#68/#70).
//
// pod-chat's host chrome now uses a BARE global `button {}` filled rule + a direct
// re-alias of the host's `--accent` / `--muted` onto the app-shell tokens — the SIMPLE
// form, safe because @jeswr/app-shell #80 made the shell SELF-ISOLATING. (pod-chat
// inherited the early-adopter hand-scoped workaround from the pod-photos/drive pilot;
// this adoption RELAXES it back to the simple form. This test pins WHY that relaxation
// is safe so a future app-shell bump that regressed the isolation would be caught here,
// not in production.)
//
//   1. Every app-shell control the host renders (the FeedbackButton trigger + every
//      control in its portaled dialog) carries `data-app-shell-control`. That is the
//      hook the package's UNLAYERED reset uses to out-rank a host's bare `button {}`
//      (an attribute selector beats a bare element selector), so the host's filled
//      look can no longer leak onto them.
//   2. The dialog is portaled to <body> (outside `.app-shell` / `.login-form`), which
//      is exactly the surface the old hand-scoping was needed to protect.
//
// (We assert the data-attribute contract rather than computed styles because jsdom
// does not run the cascade; the contract is what the unlayered reset keys off, and
// app-shell's own suite tests the cascade math. The real-browser render is verified
// at runtime in the rollout.)
