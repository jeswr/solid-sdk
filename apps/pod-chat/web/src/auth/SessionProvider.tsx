// AUTHORED-BY Claude Opus 4.8 (Fable unavailable) — re-review/upgrade candidate
//
// SessionProvider — the ONE place auth is wired for the Pod Chat static host.
// It mounts the browser-only <authorization-code-flow> popup element, builds a
// WebID-driven DPoP token provider bound to THIS origin's static Client
// Identifier Document, and calls registerGlobally() so EVERY plain `fetch()`
// (including the ones inside @jeswr/fetch-rdf and the @jeswr/pod-chat data layer)
// transparently upgrades on a 401 with a DPoP token. The library's
// `fetch?:` seam can then be left as the ambient global — no per-call wiring.
//
// LOAD-BEARING HOUSE RULES (do not "simplify" away):
//  1. @solid/reactive-authentication is pure-ESM + browser-only (custom elements,
//     popups). It is loaded via a DYNAMIC import inside an effect so it NEVER
//     evaluates at module-eval / SSR / prerender time. (This host has no SSR, but
//     keeping the dynamic import means the bundle has no top-level reactive-auth
//     evaluation — verified by the build gate.)
//  2. The 0.1.3 ReactiveFetchManager CONSTRUCTOR DOES NOT PATCH fetch — you MUST
//     call `manager.registerGlobally()`. Forgetting it is the #1 reactive-auth bug.
//  3. The client_id is the per-origin static Client Identifier Document at
//     `${origin}/clientid.jsonld` (generated at build by scripts/gen-clientid.mjs),
//     so the OP shows "Pod Chat" on the consent screen instead of a throwaway
//     dynamic registration.
//  4. `allowInsecureLoopback` is enabled ONLY for a localhost origin (dev against
//     a local CSS over HTTP); a deployed HTTPS origin stays strict.
