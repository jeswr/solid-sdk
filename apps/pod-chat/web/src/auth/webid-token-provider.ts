// AUTHORED-BY Claude Opus 4.8 (Fable unavailable) — re-review/upgrade candidate
// Ported verbatim from create-solid-app's reference provider (which itself ports
// the published 0.1.2 DPoPTokenProvider). The host shell uses its STATIC Client
// Identifier Document branch (the `clientId` option) so the consent screen shows
// "Pod Chat" instead of a throwaway dynamic registration.
/**
 * webid-token-provider.ts — a custom @solid/reactive-authentication `TokenProvider`
 * whose OIDC issuer is resolved from the user's WebID profile (via callbacks),
 * instead of the published `DPoPTokenProvider`'s hard-coded host map.
 *
 * Ported from the published `DPoPTokenProvider` (v0.1.2), preserving its
 * authorization-code + PKCE + DPoP flow and its `prompt=none` silent-retry
 * behaviour. The ONE structural change: `#resolveIssuer()` dereferences the
 * WebID and reads `solid:oidcIssuer`, then asks `chooseIssuer` when several are
 * advertised — never silently the first.
 *
 * Two app-supplied callbacks drive identity:
 *  - `getWebId()`   — UI that asks the user for their WebID (see `promptWebIdDialog`).
 *  - `getCode(uri)` — the existing `<authorization-code-flow>` element's `getCode`.
 *
 * In ADDITION to that popup flow, this provider exposes a TWO-PHASE FULL-PAGE
 * REDIRECT login ({@link WebIdDPoPTokenProvider.beginRedirectLogin} /
 * {@link WebIdDPoPTokenProvider.completeRedirectLogin}) for the Pod-Manager
 * autologin deep-link. @solid/reactive-authentication 0.1.3 has NO non-popup
 * mode, and a popup auto-opened on load (no user gesture) is browser-blocked, so
 * autologin needs a full-page redirect. Because that redirect destroys all
 * in-memory state, the two phases PERSIST the DPoP key (exported to JWK) + PKCE
 * verifier + state + nonce to sessionStorage between them. The popup path is
 * unchanged.
 *
 * `allowInsecureLoopback` is what makes LOCAL CSS work: it flips oauth4webapi's
 * `allowInsecureRequests` ONLY for `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` issuers, so the HTTP
 * issuer of a dev CSS is accepted while remote HTTPS issuers stay strict.

/**
 * The active login probe, captured per-login on the provider instance — NOT a
 * free-floating module registry, and NOT a network header.
 *
 * A login probe must prove THIS specific request — not merely "some request" —
 * was token-upgraded. Two earlier designs are rejected here:
 *
 *  - A custom `x-reactive-auth-probe-id` HEADER (round 2) broke CROSS-ORIGIN
 *    login: a custom request header makes the request non-"simple", so the browser
 *    fires a CORS preflight (OPTIONS) that many Solid pods reject — the probe
 *    failed before the 401/upgrade path ever ran. NOTHING app-specific goes on the
 *    wire.
 *  - A module-level `Map<url, id>` URL registry (round 3) was keyed only on the
 *    request URL (the one property surviving the manager's `new Request(input)`
 *    re-wrap). Keyed on URL alone, it was vulnerable to (a) a same-URL non-probe
 *    upgrade between registration and the probe's own upgrade stealing the proof,
 *    and (b) overlapping/double-clicked logins to the same storage root
 *    overwriting each other's registration.
 *
 * The round-4 design closes both: the login is SINGLE-FLIGHTED in the
 * SessionProvider, so there is never a second concurrent login (closing finding
 * (b) — no second registration can ever exist to overwrite). And the probe record
 * is held as a SINGLE generation-scoped entry ON the provider instance, so
 * `reset()` clears it for free. The record matches a request by OBJECT IDENTITY
 * first (the precise channel that survives when the manager does NOT re-wrap, e.g.
 * a direct `upgrade()` in a unit test) and falls back to URL+generation as the
 * single-use channel that carries across the manager's `new Request(input)`
 * re-wrap.
 *
 * ROUND-4B (roborev finding 2): the URL fallback alone was forgeable — keyed on
 * the bare storage-root URL, the FIRST same-URL request in the generation (even a
 * non-probe data fetch) could consume the proof. That relied on an external,
 * unverifiable "the data layer is idle mid-login" assumption. The fix makes the
 * probe URL carry a unique, UNGUESSABLE fragment ({@link withProbeFragment} →
 * `#probe-<uuid>`): an UNFORGEABLE in-process marker that (a) survives the
 * manager's `new Request(input)` re-wrap (fragments are preserved on `.url`), and
 * (b) is NEVER sent on the wire (RFC 3986 §3.5 — the browser strips it, so no
 * custom header / CORS preflight, and the pod still GETs the storage root). The
 * URL fallback now compares the FULL url-with-fragment, so an unrelated same-base
 * data fetch (no fragment, or a different/guessed one) can NEVER match. The
 * single-use latch is KEPT as defence-in-depth, but the unguessable fragment is
 * what makes the fallback genuinely collision-resistant. `upgrade()` matches on
 * the ORIGINAL request it receives — before the clone it makes to add
 * Authorization — and records the upgrade by GENERATION iff it attaches a token.
