// enforcement is `evaluate` itself, so these terms carry NO authorization weight.
//
// ODRL 2.2 has no vocabulary for an evaluation RESULT at all (it models policies +
// rules, not decisions), and the ODRL CG Formal Semantics report — which does model
// evaluation — has not published a stable term namespace. So each term below is a
// genuine gap and is MINTED under the existing `odrld:` namespace (NO new w3id

// Formal Semantics model verbatim once its namespace lands. Rationale per term:
