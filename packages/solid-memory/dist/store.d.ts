/**
 * `MemoryStore` — a Solid-pod CRUD store for `mem:MemoryItem` resources under a
 * single container, with conditional writes and a fail-closed scope guard.
 *
 * **Injectable authenticated fetch.** The store does NO crypto / DPoP itself — the
 * caller injects an already-authenticated `fetch` (e.g. from
 * `@solid/reactive-authentication` or a client-credentials DPoP fetch). This keeps
 * the store a pure LDP client (zero PSS-core risk, like `@jeswr/solid-task-model`).
 *
 * **Scope guard on every op.** Every target URL is asserted to lie under
 * `container` (see {@link ./scope.ts}) before any request — defence in depth, so a
 * caller-supplied or server-listed URL can never make the store touch a foreign
 * origin or escape the container sub-tree.
 *
 * **Redirect refusal on every op.** Every request forces `redirect: "manual"` and
 * REFUSES any redirect response (see {@link MemoryStore.request}): a credentialed
 * fetch must never transparently follow a 3xx a hostile/poisoned resource plants,
 * or the credential could be forwarded off-origin (token exfiltration).
 *
 * **RDF discipline (house rule).** The ONLY RDF the store touches is built/parsed
 * via the model (`buildMemory`/`parseMemoryTtl`), the container listing
 * (`@jeswr/fetch-rdf` `parseRdf` + `@solid/object` `ContainerDataset`), and the
 * Type-Index registration (the typed `TermWrapper` below). NEVER hand-built triples.

     *   (no read permission — a write-only caller — or a network error), the PUT still
     *   proceeds and `created` defaults to now.
     * - **`invalidatedAt` (the soft-forget tombstone)** is a SAFETY property — dropping it
     *   would silently RESURRECT a forgotten memory (a right-to-be-forgotten violation), so
     *   when it is omitted its preservation is FAIL-CLOSED: if the read FAILS (throws),
     *   `update` REJECTS rather than risk a resurrection. (A clean "resource absent" 404/410
     *   is NOT a failure — there is no tombstone to drop on a non-existent resource, so the
     *   PUT proceeds.) To update in a read-restricted context, pass `invalidatedAt`
     *   explicitly (an explicit value — including `undefined` only via {@link unforget}'s
     *   path — is authoritative and skips the read for that field).
     *
     * An explicitly-supplied value always wins and is NOT overridden by the pre-read (the
     * caller is authoritative). Because an OMITTED `invalidatedAt` is sticky, a routine
     * update never resurrects a forgotten memory; there is no way through `update` to
     * *clear* a tombstone — to deliberately **un-forget**, call {@link unforget}.
     *
     * **Escape hatch for a write-only caller.** Since `invalidatedAt: undefined` is
     * indistinguishable from omitted (so it cannot mean "assert live"), a read-restricted
     * caller that KNOWS the memory is not forgotten passes `opts.assumeNotForgotten: true`
     * — an explicit, audited acknowledgement that skips the tombstone pre-read and writes
     * NO tombstone. Use it deliberately: it CAN drop a tombstone, so only when the caller
     * is certain the target is live (or genuinely intends to clear it without a read).
     *
     * @throws if the target is outside the container; on the PUT's own non-ok response
     *   (incl. a 412 precondition failure); or — the fail-closed tombstone guard — if
     *   `invalidatedAt` is omitted (and `assumeNotForgotten` is not set) and the
     *   existence/tombstone pre-read could not be completed (so the tombstone status is
     *   unknown). A failing `created`-only pre-read does NOT throw.
