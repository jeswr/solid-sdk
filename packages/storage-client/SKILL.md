# @jeswr/storage-client

T-020 implements the ADR-003 §1 types (`src/types.ts`, re-exported as types from the root), the
§2 error model (`StorageError`, pure `toStorageError(method, url, response, bodyText?, now?)`,
`storageErrorFrom` that reads at most 64 KiB of a JSON/problem body), `./helpers`
(`retryOnConflict`, which re-reads before every retry, plus the in-house RFC 6902 `applyJsonPatch`),
and `./memory` (`createMemoryStorage({ protocol, root, pageSize, moveResource, strictConditional, clock })`).
`./solid`, `./lws` and `./testing` are still reserved (T-021…T-025).

Rules the memory backend enforces, and the real backends must match:
- Every mutation needs `ifMatch` (TypeError otherwise, unless `strictConditional: false`, where
  Solid accepts the write and LWS answers 428). On Solid, `'*'` means no precondition. On LWS it is
  `If-Match: *`, and PUT never creates (404); use `create`.
- A stale ETag gives `precondition-failed` (412) with the current `etag`. ETags change on every write,
  and a container's ETag changes only on membership changes.
- LWS lists in pages (`next` cursors are opaque), Solid lists in one page. `listAll` refuses a
  repeated page and stops at 10 000 pages.
- RDF patch applies inserts/deletes atomically, and a missing deletion is a 409 `conflict`.
  `where` is `unsupported` in memory. JSON Patch applies to JSON resources only.
- Solid moves are copy+delete emulation (new URL, capped at 2 000 resources). LWS moves need
  MoveResource (`unsupported` with `feature: 'move'` otherwise), and the server picks the name.
- LWS `setMetadata` refuses the server-managed rels `linkset`, `type` and `up`. Solid rels that are
  not IRIs map to `http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/<rel>`.
- `readRdf` with a matching `ifNoneMatch` resolves with `notModified: true` and an empty dataset
  (an extension to ADR-003's `RdfReadResult`). `writeRdf` serialises the n3-writable formats.
  JSON-LD serialisation is `unsupported` until the suite has a JSON-LD writer.

`@rdfjs/types` is a dev-only, type-only import because the layer guard does not allow it as a
runtime dependency. Consumers get it through n3 / fetch-rdf.

Before implementation, read SDK core ADR-001 D4 and `ADR-003-storage-client.md` in
`solid-suite-planning/specs/sdk-core/`, alongside this repository's `AGENTS.md`.

This package is security critical. Keep coverage thresholds at 100% and add behavioral and adversarial tests with the implementation.

Keep development tool versions aligned with the root manifest. The pinned pnpm 10.4.1 with
`ignore-scripts` requires local tool declarations for filtered scripts.

Validate changes with this package's `lint`, `build`, `typecheck`, and `test` scripts.
