/**
 * IRI safety guard for RDF serialisation.
 *
 * `n3.Writer` does NOT escape IRIs: a string handed to `namedNode()` is emitted
 * verbatim between `<…>`. It escapes newlines/tabs but NOT the delimiters that
 * matter for Turtle IRI-refs — `>` `<` `"` `{` `}` SPACE `|` `^` `` ` `` `\` — so
 * an UNTRUSTED IRI containing a `>` (or a space) closes the IRI-ref early and
 * injects arbitrary triples into the serialised document. `SceneData` fields — and
 * the scene's own SUBJECT (`resourceUrl`) — are plain, caller-supplied,
 * potentially-attacker-controlled strings; every one that becomes an IRI must pass
 * through one of these guards before reaching `namedNode()`.
 *
 * Two guards, one per RÔLE:
 *  - {@link safeHttpIri} for OBJECT links (`sceneDocument`, `thumbnail`, `about`,
 *    `wasGeneratedBy`): canonicalises via WHATWG `URL.href` (an object's exact
 *    lexeme does not carry document identity), returning `undefined` for a value
 *    that is not http(s) so the OPTIONAL triple can be DROPPED.
 *  - {@link safeSubjectBaseIri} for the REQUIRED scene SUBJECT: a subject's
 *    identity IS its exact lexeme, so it must NOT be canonicalised — it is escaped
 *    purely lexically ({@link escapeIri}) and a non-http(s)/unparseable value
 *    returns `undefined` so the caller can FAIL CLOSED (throw) rather than emit an
 *    injectable / empty subject.
 *
 * Mirrors the `safeHttpIri` pattern from `@jeswr/rdf-serialize` / `solid-dav-bridge`.

/**
 * Canonicalise an untrusted string to a Turtle-safe http(s) IRI, or `undefined`
 * when the value is not a parseable http(s) IRI. A returned value is guaranteed to
 * contain none of the characters that could break out of a Turtle `<…>` IRI-ref.
 *
 * This is the guard for OBJECT links (`sceneDocument`, `thumbnail`, `about`,
 * `wasGeneratedBy`), where an object's exact lexeme does not carry document
 * identity, so WHATWG-`URL` canonicalisation (via `URL.href`) is acceptable. For
 * the REQUIRED scene SUBJECT — whose lexical value IS the resource identity — use
 * {@link safeSubjectBaseIri}, which preserves the exact lexeme.

 * survive untouched apart from the characters that would break Turtle). The result

/**
 * Validate + LEXICALLY escape an untrusted string for use as a REQUIRED RDF SUBJECT
 * IRI base. Returns `undefined` when the value is not a parseable absolute http(s)
 * IRI — the caller then FAILS CLOSED by throwing, because a scene MUST have a valid
 * subject and there is no safe "drop" for the subject (unlike an optional object
 * link).
 *
 * Unlike {@link safeHttpIri} (used for OBJECT links) this does NOT canonicalise via
 * `URL.href`: a subject's identity is its EXACT lexical value, so the string is
 * preserved and only the Turtle-forbidden characters are percent-encoded (via
 * {@link escapeIri}) so the serialised `<…>` cannot be broken out of. A clean http(s)
 * IRI is therefore returned byte-identical (a `:443`/`:80` port and a `/../` segment
 * survive untouched); a parseable http(s) IRI that carries embedded break-out
 * characters is neutralised (escaped) into a single safe term rather than allowed to
 * inject a triple.
 *
 * **Escape FIRST, validate the ESCAPED, emit the ESCAPED.** WHATWG `URL` SILENTLY
 * rewrites its input while parsing — it strips ALL embedded C0 controls (tab/LF/CR
 * and the rest of U+0000–U+001F) and trims leading/trailing C0-controls-and-spaces
 * (U+0000–U+0020). Validating the RAW value and then emitting `escapeIri(raw)` would
 * therefore emit a lexeme that is NOT the absolute http(s) IRI that passed `new URL`.
 * So this guard:
 *  1. FAILS CLOSED on any raw C0 control anywhere, and on a leading/trailing space —
 *     a legitimate absolute http(s) IRI carries none of these raw, so reject rather
 *     than silently normalise the subject's identity; then
 *  2. escapes the (forbidden-char) set BEFORE parsing and validates + returns THAT
 *     escaped string, so the emitted lexeme is provably the one `new URL` accepted.
