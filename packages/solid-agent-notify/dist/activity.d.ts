 *
 * SECURITY (Turtle IRI-injection). `n3.Writer` does NOT escape IRIs: a string fed
 * straight to `NamedNodeFrom.string` is emitted VERBATIM between `<…>`, so a raw
 * `>` / space / `<` breaks out of the IRI and injects attacker-chosen triples into
 * the serialised document — which this package then POSTs to a peer's LDN inbox.
 * `isHttpIri` only returns a boolean and the callers used to write the RAW value,
 * so a hostile actor/target/assignee field could smuggle triples into a victim's
 * inbox. Routing every WRITE-side IRI through this validator closes that.
 *
 * We validate STRUCTURE + SCHEME via the WHATWG `URL` parser, but return the
 * LEXICALLY-preserved input via {@link escapeIri} rather than `URL.href`, because
 * RDF identity is lexical: `.href` would silently canonicalise the IRI (drop a
 * default port, lowercase the host, collapse dot-segments) and change which
 * resource the triple is about. {@link escapeIri} touches only the IRIREF-forbidden
 * characters, so the result contains no `<…>`-terminating character yet denotes the
 * exact IRI the caller supplied.
 *
 * The order is ESCAPE-FIRST, then VALIDATE-THE-ESCAPED, then EMIT-THE-ESCAPED —
 * the ONLY order that closes the WHATWG-stripping divergence. The URL parser both
 * TRIMS leading/trailing C0-control-or-space AND REMOVES *embedded* tab/newline/CR
 * (U+0009/000A/000D) from ANYWHERE before parsing, so validating the RAW value and
 * emitting an escaped copy could disagree (`ht\ntps://x` parses as `https://x` yet
 * `escapeIri` would emit `ht%0Atps://x`). By percent-encoding the FULL forbidden
 * set — including every C0 control (tab/nl/cr → `%09`/`%0A`/`%0D`) — BEFORE
 * `new URL()`, the parser has nothing left to strip, so the string we validate is
 * byte-identical to the string we emit. A leading/trailing C0-or-space is still
 * rejected outright (rather than emitted as a `%XX`-suffixed IRI) so a stray edge
 * byte can't silently change which resource the IRI denotes.
