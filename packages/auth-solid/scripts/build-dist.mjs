// AUTHORED-BY Claude Opus 4.8 (Fable unavailable) — re-review/upgrade candidate
/**
 * build-dist — produce the committed, self-contained `dist/` for GitHub-branch installs
 * under `ignore-scripts=true`.
 *
 * WHY a bundler (esbuild) instead of plain `tsc`:
 *
 * `@jeswr/auth-solid` depends on the OFF-NPM git dep `@jeswr/solid-dpop` (whose only runtime dep
 * is the npm-published `jose`). A consumer running `npm install github:jeswr/auth-solid#main` under
 * the suite's `ignore-scripts=true` invariant will NOT run our `prepare`/`build`, nor solid-dpop's.
 * solid-dpop DOES commit a self-contained `dist/`, but to make OUR install artifact robust
 * regardless of how that dep was resolved we INLINE `@jeswr/solid-dpop` into our `dist/index.js`.
 *
 * Externalisation contract (the load-bearing part):
 *   - INLINED  (bundled into dist/index.js): the off-npm `@jeswr/*` git deps only —
 *       `@jeswr/solid-dpop`.
 *   - EXTERNAL (resolved from npm by the consumer):
 *       - `jose` — solid-dpop's only runtime dep (npm-published; kept external so a single shared
 *         copy + normal dedupe/audit apply).
 *       - `@auth/core` — a PEER dependency the consumer installs and de-dupes. We import ONLY its
 *         `customFetch` symbol + types from it; bundling a peer would defeat the point (the whole
 *         package exists to plug into the consumer's audited Auth.js, not ship our own).
 *       - node: builtins.
 *   Computed from `package.json` so adding an npm dep automatically keeps it external (the
 *   inline-only-@jeswr contract holds without editing a list).
 *
 * `tsc` still emits the `.d.ts` declarations; esbuild owns the JS. The committed `dist/` is kept
 * in sync with `src/` by `scripts/check-dist-fresh.mjs`.
