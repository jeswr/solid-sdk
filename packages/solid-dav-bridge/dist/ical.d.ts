/**
 * A minimal, self-contained iCalendar / vCard CONTENT-LINE parser — the shared
 * RFC 5545 §3.1 / RFC 6350 §3.2 grammar (both formats line-fold and
 * property-parse identically).
 *
 * **Why in-house, not a third-party parser.** The suite's GitHub-installable
 * rule requires a SELF-CONTAINED committed `dist/` that installs under
 * `ignore-scripts=true` with no build step. A third-party iCal parser
 * (`ical.js`, `node-ical`, `vcf`) would have to be esbuild-INLINED into `dist/`
 * to satisfy that — pulling its whole (RRULE-expansion / timezone-database)
 * surface into the audit. This bridge does NOT expand recurrences in phase 1
 * (it carries the raw `RRULE` string), so it needs only the line/property/param
 * grammar — a small, exhaustively-testable parser. Keeping it in-house shrinks
 * the reviewable + installable surface to exactly what we use, with no inlined
 * dependency. (If full RRULE expansion is added later, revisit whether `ical.js`
 * — esbuild-inlined — then earns its place; tracked as a follow-up.)
 *
 * Every input is treated as UNTRUSTED: the parser never throws on malformed
 * lines (a line without a `:` is skipped), and it imposes hard caps on line
 * length, line count and total size so a hostile file cannot exhaust memory.
