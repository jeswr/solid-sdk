> Experimental — AI-agent-generated. Security-critical; private until conformance is gate-green.

Source API and export-file adapters extracted with history from Pod Manager. The default
catalog is unconfigured and uses recorded fixtures for demos. No environment variables are
read by this package: the host injects public OAuth client ids and token proxy URLs.

```ts
import { createRegistry, createFetchPodWriter, runImport } from '@jeswr/pod-connectors';

const registry = createRegistry({ spotify: { clientId: 'public-client-id' } });
const adapter = registry.adapterById('spotify')!;
const report = await runImport({
  adapter,
  mode: 'demo',
  podWriter: createFetchPodWriter({
    adapterId: adapter.metadata.id,
    webId,
    profileDocumentUrl, // final profile document URL from the host's existing profile load
    podRoot,
    fetch: authenticatedPodFetch,
  }),
});
```

Live imports take `sourceAuth: { fetch: authenticatedSourceFetch }`. The optional
`createSourceAuth(id, adapter, token, sourceFetch)` helper adds bearer and adapter headers.
The helper binds credentials to an HTTPS-only origin allowlist (default: static fixture route origins)
and refuses redirects; pass a fifth argument to supply additional API origins explicitly.
Hosts must capture a pristine `sourceFetch` before initializing Solid authentication and
pass it to `authorize(id, config, sourceFetch)` as well as `createSourceAuth`. Pass the
auth manager's separate `podFetch` to `createFetchPodWriter`; never use the patched global
fetch for source API requests or token exchange. Tokens stay in memory. A `PodWriter` binds a
connector container, resolves and reads slugs, writes RDF with `{ ifMatch }` or
`{ ifNoneMatch: '*' }`, and registers Type Index entries. The fetch-backed implementation
confines document reads, writes and every redirect hop to the connector container. Type
Index operations separately validate the profile-selected index against the WebID's advertised
`pim:storage` and `solid:storage` roots, independently of the import destination,
allow only that document (or the bootstrap target), and refuse redirects. The profile
read/update is pinned to the host-supplied canonical `profileDocumentUrl`, resolved after
redirects during the host's existing profile load. The WebID remains the RDF subject.
Registration never dereferences the redirecting WebID or makes an unauthenticated profile
request, and all authenticated profile and Type Index operations refuse redirects.
Every connector RDF read, including registration, rejects JSON-LD context URLs with
`RemoteContextRefusedError` and never fetches a context. Inline context objects remain supported.
Deterministic document paths and Type Index bootstrap
behavior are preserved. The runner
retains read preconditions for subsequent writes; explicit write conditions override them.

Entry points:

- `.`: contracts, runners, catalog, config factory, fetch-backed writer, errors.
- `./oauth`: browser PKCE helpers and popup flow (only `authorize` touches `window`).
- `./node`: Node CLI, client-credentials Pod fetch, loopback source PKCE and state store.
- `./testing`: recorded fixture fetch, memory Pod and import helpers; fail-closed fixture recorder.
- `./adapters/<id>`: each source's existing adapter (OAuth or export-file).
- `./core/*`, `./pod/*`, `./<id>/*`, `./registry`, `./types`, `./file-adapters`:
  compatibility modules used by Pod Manager's thin re-export shims.

`pnpm --filter @jeswr/pod-connectors build` builds ESM and declarations. `test` runs all
moved fixture tests and the environment-read regression test without production traffic.

## Node CLI

Build the package and run `pod-connectors import spotify`, or
`node packages/pod-connectors/dist/node/bin.js import spotify` from the workspace.
`import netflix --file ./NetflixViewingHistory.csv` uses the file runner. Add the bare
`--since` flag to an API import to resume its stored cursor; omission starts a full import.
File imports reject `--since`. `--help` prints usage.

The CLI reads `~/.config/solid-mcp/config.json` (W9 MCP-12's location). It refuses symlinks,
non-regular files, another user's files, and any mode other than **0600**, including 0400.
Set `chmod 600 ~/.config/solid-mcp/config.json`. The current MCP-12 spec has no JSON schema;
CON-03 uses these camelCase fields pending confirmation in root `QUESTIONS.md`:

```json
{
  "podRoot": "https://pod.example/alice/",
  "webId": "https://pod.example/alice/profile/card#me",
  "oidcIssuer": "https://issuer.example/",
  "clientId": "<CSS account token id>",
  "clientSecret": "<CSS account token secret>",
  "readOnly": false,
  "connectors": {
    "spotify": { "clientId": "<registered public source client id>" },
    "twitch": {
      "clientId": "<registered Twitch client id>",
      "tokenProxyUrl": "https://proxy.example/twitch/token",
      "callbackPort": 49152
    }
  }
}
```

Optional `tokenUrl` pins the Pod token endpoint instead of discovering it. Optional
`profileDocumentUrl` pins the canonical profile document; otherwise the WebID without its
fragment is used and any redirect is refused. URLs use HTTPS. `readOnly: true` refuses the
import. Each `connectors[id]` may also supply `tokenProxyUrl` or an installed-app
`clientSecret`. A local source secret selects direct exchange with the adapter's HTTPS token
endpoint, taking precedence over a token proxy. Without a local secret, the adapter's configured
proxy mode is preserved. These secrets and all session/source tokens remain in memory.
Direct exchanges request JSON token responses, including GitHub. The provider's `tokenRequest`
selects form-post secrets (the default), HTTP Basic with a form body (Fitbit), or HTTP Basic
with a JSON body (Notion) for a local secret. Proxy flows keep the shared form contract.

Pod login uses CSS client credentials and DPoP, including bounded nonce retries and an
in-memory token cache. Source login displays a browser URL, binds only `127.0.0.1` on an
OS-assigned port by default, and uses state plus S256 PKCE. Set `connectors[id].callbackPort`
to an integer from **1024 to 65535** for a fixed loopback callback. Twitch requires this
setting with either a local secret or a token proxy; omitting it fails with a configuration
error before opening the browser. Register the exact URI
`http://127.0.0.1:<callbackPort>/oauth-callback` with the provider (for the example above,
`http://127.0.0.1:49152/oauth-callback`). The host and path cannot be configured, and a busy
port fails login without falling back to another port. The flow times out after two minutes.
Pod and source transports never share credentials;
all authenticated transports refuse redirects. SIGINT/SIGTERM cancel the CLI.
Profile-selected Type Index documents must also use HTTPS, even in another advertised storage.

The CLI stores `<podRoot>integrations/<id>/state.json`, including failed outcomes while
retaining the last successful checkpoint. Before accessing JSON, it discovers the resource's
`rel="acl"` link and writes a WAC ACL granting only the owner WebID Read, Write and Control.
The ACL must be in the same connector container. Missing ACL discovery or rejected ACL
writes fail closed; ACP/LWS state protection belongs to later storage integration.
Conditional JSON PUTs reject stale ETags and concurrent creates. State persistence failures
fail the command even if import documents were already written; deterministic slugs allow retry.

Exit codes: **0** success/help, **1** import/state failure, **2** usage/config/file error,
**3** Pod/source login failure, **130** cancellation. Error output uses constant messages
and excludes server responses, tokens, and arbitrary exception text.

Programmatic hosts can import `runCli`, `authorizeLoopback`, `createClientCredentialsFetch`,
and `createStateStore` from `./node`. `runCli(args, options)` takes output callbacks,
`configPath`, independent `podTransport`/`sourceTransport`, an abort signal and an optional
`openAuthorizationUrl` callback. For headless tests pass fixture-backed
`sourceAuth: { fetch }` (including a fixture recorder); Pod client-credentials exchange can
run against a stub transport over the memory Pod. Importing `./node` starts no command or listener.
`authorizeLoopback` accepts the same optional `callbackPort` in its source config.
The fetch returned by `createClientCredentialsFetch` preserves the effective request signal
(`init.signal` overrides a Request's signal), including request-body buffering, token refresh
and DPoP nonce retries. Cancellation rejects with the abort reason and cancels the body reader.
Already-aborted requests reject before any resource request or refresh is sent.
Checkpoint JSON reads enforce a 1 MiB byte limit using both content-length and streamed chunks,
and cancel oversized response bodies.

## Incremental imports and provenance

Pass host-owned `state: ConnectorState` into `runImport` (or `runFileImport`) and persist
`report.state` after success. `onState` also receives failed outcomes, preserving the previous
successful cursor, sync time and counts. State contains ISO date strings and never tokens or
exception text. An explicit `cursor` overrides the state's cursor for API imports.

The shared write pipeline reads each deterministic slug before writing. Documents default to
replacement (`writeMode: 'replace'`), preserving snapshot behavior for Spotify, GitHub and other
existing adapters, including empty snapshots and deletions from a dataset returned by `ctx.read`.
Incremental adapters can set `NormalisedDoc.writeMode: 'merge'` to replace descriptions of incoming
deterministic named subjects while retaining subjects absent from the current page.
`schema:identifier` is descriptive metadata and may be shared by distinct items (for example,
lines of one Amazon order). Adapters must use deterministic linked-node identifiers and implement
source-specific deletions with replacement writes. ETags and create-only conditions protect both
write modes; a 412 surfaces to the host without advancing its checkpoint. Repeated writes re-read
the current ETag.

Every collection and item carries `prov:wasDerivedFrom` and `prov:wasGeneratedBy`. Item
`schema:url` supplies its source; `NormalisedDoc.sourceUrl` can supply a document-specific
fallback. Otherwise the source API origin or a connector export URN is used. Each run has one
activity in the connector's reserved `_provenance.ttl`, with source IRIs, connector IRI and
start/end times. This companion document is excluded from imported-document counts and Type
Index registration. Failed runs attempt provenance recording and retain the original error.

Each adapter exposes a `vocab-map.ts` seam, applied by the runner without mutating adapter
input. Existing music, calendar and social class alignments add sector types alongside legacy
types. Detailed adapter field mappings remain with their later connector tasks. The ontology
package currently has no runtime API, so its exact term IRIs are isolated in
`core/federation-vocab.ts` for the subsequent constants switch (see root `QUESTIONS.md`).

## Recording fixtures

```ts
import { createFixtureRecorder } from '@jeswr/pod-connectors/testing';

const recorder = createFixtureRecorder({
  fetch: injectedSourceFetch,
  routes: [{
    url: 'https://source.example/items', // public static prefix, no query/fragment
    safeFields: ['total', 'items.*.syntheticId'], // explicitly non-personal scalars
  }],
});
// Pass recorder.fetch through SourceAuth; save recorder.fixtures() in the host.
```

Recording preserves the original response for the adapter. Saved fixtures contain the static
route prefix, method, status and redacted JSON only. Recording and replay select the longest
matching prefix on the same origin and complete path segments, independently of route or request
order. Responses sharing a method and static prefix replay in request order, even if recording
responses complete out of order. Repeated
keys form a finite sequence; replay fails when that sequence is exhausted. Single-entry keys
remain reusable for existing static demo fixtures. All headers, request bodies, dynamic URLs
and unlisted JSON fields are omitted. Known token, cookie and personal keys cannot be
allowlisted; empty allowlists are the default. Hosts must ensure every allowed scalar is
non-personal and use synthetic replacements when replay requires personal fields. Tests use
mocked source transports and memory Pods only.
