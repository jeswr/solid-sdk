// AUTHORED-BY Claude Opus 4.8 (Fable unavailable) — re-review/upgrade candidate
//
// Key <-> LDP-path mapping for the Solid unstorage driver.
//
// unstorage keys are `:`-delimited (e.g. `foo:bar:baz`). This module maps a key
// to an LDP resource URL UNDER a fixed `base` container, and maps a member URL
// discovered in a container listing back to a key. The round-trip MUST be exact.
//
// The mapping is the driver's primary SECURITY surface: a key ultimately becomes
// a URL we issue an authenticated request to. So it is fail-closed against path
// traversal (`..`) and absolute / scheme-bearing segments — a key can NEVER
// escape the `base` container, point at a different origin, or smuggle a
// `..`/`.`/`//` past us.
//
// Mapping rules (documented here and in the README — keep both in sync):
//   - `base` is normalised to exactly one trailing `/` (a container URL).
//   - The key is split on `:` into segments. Each non-empty segment is
//     `encodeURIComponent`-encoded and the segments are joined with `/`.
//   - Empty segments (a leading/trailing/double `:`) are rejected — they would
//     produce `//` or a trailing `/` and so blur the resource/container line.
//   - A decoded segment equal to `.` or `..` is rejected (traversal guard).
//   - The resulting URL is resolved against `base` and re-validated to be a
//     strict descendant of `base` (defence in depth against any encoding trick).

/** A key segment that, decoded, would traverse the path. */
const TRAVERSAL_SEGMENTS = new Set([".", ".."]);

/**
 * Map a single URL path segment back to a KEY segment that round-trips exactly
 * through {@link keyToUrl}.
 *
 * The segment is decoded for readability (so a space stays a space, `#`/`?` stay
 * literal), BUT the four characters that carry meaning at the KEY level — `%`
 * (escape introducer), `:` (the key separator), and `/`/`\` (rejected as raw
 * traversal vectors) — are re-escaped so the produced key segment:
 *   - contains no raw `:`/`/`/`\` (cannot introduce a false separator or be
 *     rejected by the raw-slash guard), and
 *   - decodes cleanly back to the original value (escaping `%` first keeps any
 *     literal `%` in the decoded value a well-formed `%25`).
 *
 * So a single URL segment always maps to a single key segment, and
 * `keyToUrl(base, urlToKey(base, url)) === url` for every member URL we emit.
 * (A "nice" segment with none of those four characters is returned decoded
 * verbatim — the human-readable canonical form.)
