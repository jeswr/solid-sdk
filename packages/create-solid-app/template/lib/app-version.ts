// app-version.ts — the build identifier attached to user feedback. The shared
// @jeswr/app-shell <FeedbackButton> stamps it into the issue's diagnostics so a
// report can be tied to a specific build.
//
// Prefer the deploy's git SHA, set at BUILD time via NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_SHA —
// NEXT_PUBLIC_* vars are inlined by Next at build, so this resolves to a static
// string. Keep the read as a direct `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_SHA` property
// access (not a computed key) so Next's static replacement can see and inline
// it. When unset (local dev / a build that doesn't pass one) we fall back to the
// package version so the value is always a sensible, non-empty string.
