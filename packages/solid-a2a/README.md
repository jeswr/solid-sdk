# @jeswr/solid-a2a

Translate natural-language agent requests into RDF intents and validate them against hash-pinned
SHACL protocol documents.

The library is transport- and model-independent: common intents use deterministic parsing, while
unmatched text can be passed to an injected translator.

> Experimental. Security-bearing exchanges must not silently downgrade from validated RDF back to
> natural language.

## Install

```sh
npm install github:jeswr/solid-a2a#main
```

Requires Node.js 24 or newer.

## Minimal usage

```ts
import {
  buildProtocolDocument,
  buildResponseShape,
  buildShapeForIntent,
  parseIntent,
  validateIntent,
} from "@jeswr/solid-a2a";

const parsed = await parseIntent(
  "share read access to https://alice.example/notes.ttl with https://bob.example/profile#me",
);
if (!parsed.resolved || !parsed.intent) throw new Error(parsed.reason);

const requestShape = buildShapeForIntent("grant");
const report = await validateIntent(parsed.intent, requestShape);
if (!report.conforms) throw new Error("Intent does not conform to the protocol shape");

const protocol = await buildProtocolDocument({
  requestShape,
  responseShape: buildResponseShape("https://schema.org/AuthorizeAction"),
  meta: { id: "https://alice.example/protocols/grant#v1", name: "Grant access", version: "1" },
});
```

## Key API

- Intent translation: `parseIntent` and the optional `TranslateFn` seam.
- RDF: `intentToTurtle`, `intentToJsonLd`, `parseIntentGraph`, `intentFromRdf`.
- SHACL: `buildShapeForIntent`, `buildResponseShape`, `validateIntent`.
- Protocol documents: `buildProtocolDocument`, `verifyProtocolDocument`, `hashQuads`.
- Handshake: `encodeUpgradeOffer`, `decodeUpgradeOffer`, `encodeUpgradeResponse`,
  `decodeUpgradeResponse`, `mayDowngradeToNl`, and RDF codecs.

## Vocabulary compatibility

New intents, shapes, protocol metadata and handshakes use `https://jeswr.org/ns/a2a#`.
Readers and `validateIntent` also accept `https://w3id.org/jeswr/a2a#`, including mixed graphs.
Validation resolves vocabulary aliases in a temporary view; it never rewrites the supplied
graph. Instance subjects and resource references keep their exact IRIs, so validation and
parsing follow the same action and parameter nodes.

Existing protocol bodies and their hashes remain unchanged: `hashQuads` and
`verifyProtocolDocument` hash the supplied IRIs exactly. Newly built canonical protocol
bodies have new hashes. Caller-supplied shape bodies and protocol/shape identifiers are
preserved, including legacy shapes already pinned by a hash. The published
`https://w3id.org/jeswr/a2a-rdf/v1` specification URLs remain unchanged.
