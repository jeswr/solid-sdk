// AUTHORED-BY Claude Opus 4.8 (Fable unavailable) — re-review/upgrade candidate
/**
 * build-dist — produce the committed, self-contained `dist/` for GitHub-branch
 * installs under `ignore-scripts=true`.
 *
 * WHY a bundler (esbuild) instead of plain `tsc`:
 *
 * `@jeswr/federation-client` depends on TWO off-npm `@jeswr/*` packages —
 * `@jeswr/fetch-rdf` and `@jeswr/federation-registry` — that a consumer running
 * `npm install github:jeswr/federation-client#main` under the suite's
 * `ignore-scripts=true` invariant cannot resolve/build (fetch-rdf ships no usable
 * `dist/`; federation-registry is a git-only package not on the npm registry). So
 * the consumer's import would fail. The fix is to make the committed artifact
 * self-contained re: those off-npm deps by INLINING their compiled code into our
 * `dist/index.js`. (The registry's own bundle already inlines its copy of
 * `@jeswr/fetch-rdf`, so the result is self-contained transitively.)
 *
 * Externalisation contract (the load-bearing part):
 *   - INLINED  (bundled into dist): the off-npm `@jeswr/*` deps —
 *       `@jeswr/fetch-rdf` AND `@jeswr/federation-registry` — by virtue of being
 *       ABSENT from the EXTERNAL list below.
 *   - EXTERNAL (resolved from npm by the consumer): everything else —
 *       `n3`, `@solid/object`, `@rdfjs/wrapper`, `@rdfjs/types`, AND the off-npm
 *       deps' OWN npm runtime deps `jsonld-streaming-parser` + `content-type`
 *       (all npm-published; we add them to our `dependencies` so the consumer
 *       resolves them). We deliberately do NOT bundle these — keeping them
 *       external means a single shared copy + normal npm dedupe/audit.
 *
 * `tsc` still emits the `.d.ts` declarations (declarations carry no fetch-rdf
 * type import — verified — so they are already self-contained). esbuild owns the
 * JS; tsc owns the types (declaration-only).
 *
 * The committed `dist/` is kept in sync with `src/` by `scripts/check-dist-fresh.mjs`.

/**
 * The Node entry (`./node` → dist/node.js) additionally keeps external:
 *   - `undici` — an npm-published runtime `dependency` resolved by the consumer (NOT
 *     inlined). The `./node` entry is the ONLY artifact that references `undici`, so the
 *     default `.` entry (dist/index.js) is unaffected and the browser bundle never sees
 *     it (task #92);
 *   - `./index.js` — the package ROOT bundle. `node.ts` imports the SSRF guard +
 *     `SsrfError` + `isPublicAddress`/`isLoopbackAddress` from `./index.js`, NOT a fresh
 *     inline of `./ssrf.ts`. Keeping `./index.js` external makes `dist/node.js` reference
 *     the SAME runtime `SsrfError` class as `dist/index.js`, so an error thrown by
 *     `@jeswr/federation-client/node` satisfies `instanceof SsrfError` imported from
 *     `@jeswr/federation-client` in published builds (roborev finding: avoid two split
 *     `SsrfError` classes). At runtime `dist/node.js`'s `import "./index.js"` resolves to
 *     the sibling `dist/index.js`;
 *   - Node builtins (`node:dns`, `node:net`) — external on `platform:"node"` by default;
 *     named for clarity.
