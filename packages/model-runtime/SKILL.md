description: Use when loading a generated domain model (model.js from @jeswr/federation-codegen), calling defineModel on a shape-manifest, reading or writing pod RDF through generated entities, or changing the audited guard set in @jeswr/model-runtime.

# Generated-model runtime

`@jeswr/model-runtime` lives in `packages/model-runtime` and is security-critical. It is the
one interpreter for every generated domain model: a generated `model.js` inlines a JSON
shape-manifest and calls `defineModel(manifest)`; all behaviour lives here.

```ts
import model, { entities } from "./generated/model.js"; // emitted by federation-codegen

const bookmark = entities.Bookmark;
const store = bookmark.build(resourceUrl, { url: "https://example.org/a" }); // n3 Store
const data = bookmark.parse(resourceUrl, dataset);      // object | undefined (fail-closed)
const ttl = await bookmark.serialize(resourceUrl, data); // n3.Writer Turtle
const parsed = await bookmark.parseDocument(resourceUrl, body, contentType); // via @jeswr/fetch-rdf
const w = new bookmark.Wrapper(bookmark.subject(resourceUrl), store, DataFactory);
```

## Rules

- Never hand-write a manifest for production use. Manifests come from `federation-codegen`,
  whose fidelity assertion proves every field traces to `shapes.ttl` or the committed config.
- Keep generated artifacts data-only. A manifest must never carry code, regex source,
  templates or path expressions; `validateManifest` rejects unknown keys and enforces caps.
- Every IRI field with `iriScheme: "http-https"` goes through `httpIriOrUndefined` on read
  and write. Do not add a bypass; widen schemes only with a new reviewed guard.
- A Violation-graded MUST (`requiredFailClosed`) rejects the whole record on parse and the
  build. Warning/Info constraints drop the field and admit the record.
- Composite entities graph-walk real link triples from the root; never assume fragments.
- Domain policy the schema cannot express (network fetches, SSRF policy, reconciliation)
  belongs in the consuming package's facade, not in this runtime.
- Changes here are security-critical: add an adversarial test that fails before the fix.

## Exports

`defineModel`, `validateManifest`, `ManifestError`, `MANIFEST_VERSION`, `RUNTIME_MAJOR`,
manifest types, and the shared guards `httpIriOrUndefined`, `isHttpIri`, `sanitizeText`,
`tryRead` plus the XSD datatype mappers. Packages migrating off hand-written models may reuse
the guards so their filter behaviour stays byte-identical.
